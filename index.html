                    Ever Felt Too Lost Or You Know Way Too Much Alone? I Feel It Oftenly, I Dont Know Why! Its Like A Moment Ago I Was Sitting With My Friends And Enjoying, Giggling, Smiling, Laughing, ETC And Now Its Just Been 5-10Mins They Have Left, I Am Looking At The Sky, Thinking Whats Going In My Life. Feeling That No One There To Listen To My Thoughts, No One's There To Ask What's Going On Your Mind! This Feeling Is Something That Eats You Up Completely And To Be Honest, You Would Never Want To Experience This. Like All OF Your Past Right In Front Of Your Eyes And You Can't Do Anything About It, Except Just Accept That Yeah All That Happened With Me, And I Deserved That I Guess! This Phase Of Life Is Very Tough, Eats Up All The Strength That You Have, Makes You Feel Like A Loser, Who Was Never Accepted by Anyone! Am Fighting Through One Right Now! And I know That I Will Get Out Of This. Its Just I Did Not Deserved To Be Used And Thrown By So Many. I'll Be Better Than You Guys And That's A Promise!
