                    Ever Felt Too Lost Or You Know Way Too Much Alone? I Feel It Oftenly, I Dont Know Why! Its Like A Moment Ago I Was Sitting With My Friends And Enjoying, Giggling, Smiling, Laughing, ETC And Now Its Just Been 5-10Mins They Have Left, I Am Looking At The Sky, Thinking Whats Going In My Life. Feeling That No One There To Listen To My Thoughts, No One's There To Ask What's Going On Your Mind! This Feeling Is Something That Eats You Up Completely And To Be Honest, You Would Never Want To Experience This. Like All OF Your Past Right In Front Of Your Eyes And You Can't Do Anything About It, Except Just Accept That Yeah All That Happened With Me, And I Deserved That I Guess! This Phase Of Life Is Very Tough, Eats Up All The Strength That You Have, Makes You Feel Like A Loser, Who Was Never Accepted by Anyone! Am Fighting Through One Right Now! And I know That I Will Get Out Of This. Its Just I Did Not Deserved To Be Used And Thrown By So Many. I'll Be Better Than You Guys And That's A Promise!

                    Ever happened,  you wanted to cry so badly but you just can't cry! You gotta stay strong for others because they just look at you for strength. You are their person of strength and you just can't show them that you also breakdown. You sometimes staying this tough becomes way too difficult because no human is made that way. Every human breaksdown very badly sometimes when they need just a shoulder to cry on and be convinced that they too deserve love and care. But the question is can you give them that strength? CAN YOU KEEP HIM IN FRONT OF YOU AS HE DOES EVERYTIME? Well its upto you to decide but yeah we boys too need people to cry and throw all the things that's inside us. Every guy goes through a lot from their childhood to their teenage to their adulthood. But what do we get to hear when we try to express stuff, Clingy, Simp, Emotional Fool? Well that's just a few words that we get to hear! Change your mentality guys, Even boys may need to cry! You can't even imagine what we go through our whole lives! Just like we take care of you when you are at your lowest, give you care when you need it the most without thinking of ourselves, WE JUST NEED THE SAME WITHOUT JUDGEMENT!
